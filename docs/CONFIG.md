The configuration file **ffplayout.yml** have this sections:

---

```YAML
general:
    stop_on_error: True
    stop_threshold: 11
```
sometimes it can happen, that a file is corrupt but still playable,
this can produce an streaming error over all following files.
The only way in this case is, to stop ffplayout and start it again
here we only say it can stop, the starting process is in your hand
best way is a **systemd serivce** on linux.
`stop_threshold:` stop ffplayout, if it is async in time above this value.

```YAML
mail:
    subject: "Playout Error"
    smpt_server: "mail.example.org"
    smpt_port: 587
    sender_addr: "ffplayout@example.org"
    sender_pass: "12345"
    recipient:
    mail_level: "ERROR"
```
Send error messages to email address, like:
- missing playlist
- unvalid json format
- missing clip path
leave recipient blank, if you don't need this.
`mail_level` can be: **WARNING, ERROR**

```YAML
logging:
    log_to_file: True
    log_path: "/var/log/ffplayout/"
    log_level: "DEBUG"
    ffmpeg_level: "ERROR"
```

Logging to file, if `log_to_file = False` > log to console.
Path to **/var/log/** only if you run this program as *deamon*.
`log_level` can be: **DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR**
`ffmpeg_level` can be: **INFO, WARNING, ERROR**

```YAML
pre_compress:
    width: 1024
    height: 576
    aspect: 1.778
    fps: 25
    add_logo: True
    logo: "docs/logo.png"
    logo_opacity: 0.7
    logo_filter: "overlay=W-w-12:12"
    add_loudnorm: False
    loud_I: -18
    loud_TP: -1.5
    loud_LRA: 11
```

ffmpeg pre-compression settings, all clips get prepared in that way,
so the input for the final compression is unique.
- `aspect` mus be a float number.
- with `logo_opacity` logo can make transparent
- with `logo_filter = overlay=W-w-12:12` you can modify the logo position
- with use_loudnorm you can activate single pass EBU R128 loudness normalization
- loud_* can adjust the loudnorm filter

**INFO:** output is progressive!

```YAML
playlist:
    playlist_mode: True
    path: "/playlists"
    day_start: "5:59:25"
    length: "24:00:00"
```
Playlist settings -
set `playlist_mode` to **False** if you want to play clips from the `storage:` section
put only the root path here, for example: **"/playlists"**.
Subfolders is read by the script and needs this structur:
- **"/playlists/2018/01"** (/playlists/year/month)

`day_start` means at which time the playlist should start. Leave `day_start` blank when playlist should always start at the begin.
`length` represent the target length from playlist, when is blank real length will not consider.

```YAML
storage:
    path: "/mediaStorage"
    filler_path: "/mediaStorage/filler/filler-clips"
    filler_clip: "/mediaStorage/filler/filler.mp4"
    extensions:
        - "*.mp4"
        - "*.mkv"
    shuffle: True
```
Play ordered or ramdomly files from path, `filler_path` are for the GUI only at the moment.
`filler_clip` is for fill the end to reach 24 hours, it will loop when is necessary.
`extensions:` search only files with this extension, add as many as you want.
Set `shuffle` to **True** to pick files randomly.

    add_text: True
    bind_address: "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555"
    fontfile: "/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf"
```
Overlay text in combination with [messenger](https://github.com/ffplayout/messenger).
On windows `fontfile` path need to be like this: **C\:/WINDOWS/fonts/DejaVuSans.ttf**.
In a standard environment the filter drawtext node is: **Parsed_drawtext_2**.

    service_provider: "example.org"
    post_ffmpeg_param:
        c:v: "libx264"
